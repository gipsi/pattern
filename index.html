  <h6>Smatterers by Samuel Butler</h6>
  
  <p>1<sup>st</sup> poem.<br>
     All smatterers are more brisk and pert<br>
     Than those that understand an art;<br>
     As little sparkles shine more bright<br>
     Than glowing coals, that give them light.</p>

  <h6>Hamlet by Walter de la Mare</h6> 
  
  <p><pre><u>Umbrageous cedars</u> murmuring symphonies
      Stooped in late twilight o'er <sub>dark Denmark's Prince:</sub>
      He sat, his eyes companioned with dream -
      <b>Lustrous <u>large</b> eyes</u> that <b>held the world in view</b>
      As some entranc&#232d child's a puppet show.
      Darkness gave birth to the all-trembling stars,
      And a far roar of long-drawn cataracts,
      Flooding <b><u>immeasurable night</u></b> with sound.
      He sat so still, his very thoughts took wing,
      And, lightest Ariels, the stillness haunted
      With midge-like measures; but, at last, even they
      Sank 'neath the influences of his night.
      <i>The sweet dust shed faint perfume in the gloom;</i>
      Through all wild space the stars' bright arrows fell
      On the lone Prince <b>- the troubled son of man -</b>
      On <u>Time's dark waters</u> in unearthly trouble:
      Then, as the roar increased, and one fair tower
      Of cloud took sky and stars with majesty,
      He rose, his face a parchment of old age,
      Sorrow hath scribbled o'er, and o'er, and o'er.</p></pre>
